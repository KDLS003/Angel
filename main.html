May mga pikunan, sagutan pero mas marami ang tawanan. Then sa school, palagi mo tinatanong kung nasan si barbie. Kahit sa chat! we were just two kids na nagkukulitan and I started to care for you as we aged until we became best friends.</div>

            <div class="text">This is the best and worst phase of my life. Best kasi nagustuhan ako ng best friend ko and worst kasi I made the worst decision. Nag back read ako sa convo natin para ma freshen up yung memories ko. Tangina, kinikilig ako HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Parang akong tanga na ngumingiti magisa HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA. Ikaw lang ang nagparamdam saakin ng ganun and I remembered how does it feel to fall in love with my best friend. Kaso, habang kinikilig ako, na iinis at nag crcringe naman ako sa sarili ko noon. Ka gago ko putcha, I hate that I made you feel that way. I should have been honest and told you the current situation of my family back then. kasi nga lilipat ng school and move back sa province. Kala ko kasi na cool yung mag ghost and I should have not listen to those advices back then. ('di mo alam yan no? HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA) Hindi ko naman sinisisi sakanila yun kasi at the end of the day, i'm still the one who will decide on what i'll do. </div>

Mahirap man ang napili nating course (pero mas mahirap yung sayo) sure ako na kakayanin natin yan. Hardwork will always pay off and soon, we'll be living the life we wanted. I'll always have your back, through ups and down, nandito ako palagi para sayo. Need coffee? hahatiran kita ng coffee sa room mo, I gotchu.

Your true beauty shines through your personality and your kind heart. If there's ever a time when you need a reminder of just how amazing you are, don't hesitate to reach out.

        <div class="letter">
          I hope you enjoyed my simple gift to you. I thought two weeks is enough to finish the website kaso marami pa akong gustong ilagay na features and designs that I have in my mind kaso di pa ako magaling eh HAHAHAHAHAHAHA. All the words I said are true and there's no sugar cointing on it. I just wanted to let you know how grateful I am to have you in my life. Looking back, I realize that we've had our fair share of rough patches in the past. But you know what? Life is all about learning and growing, and I've learned from my mistakes. I promise you that I won't repeat them because I cherish our relationship way too much to let anything come between us again. I'll also lessen of me saying sorry because the more I say sorry, it decreases the true meaning of sorry. Nawawalan na ng halaga ang sorry ko. Let's focus on the present and embrace each moment with open hearts. We don't need to rush anything or put pressure on ourselves. Instead, let's cherish the simple joys, the laughter, and the memories we will create together. Let's make the most of every chance we get and create a beautiful future together, leaving all the bitterness past behind. Remember, I'll always be here to lend an ear, share a laugh, sit in silence with you, or just do nothing with you. May this year be filled with laughter, adventure, and endless blessings. You deserve all the love and happiness in the world, and I will always be here to ensure you have them in abundance. You deserve nothing but the best, today and always. Happy birthday, my Angel!
